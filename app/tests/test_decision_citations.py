"""Every place that cites a decision by title names something that exists, and the decisions index is true.

A citation is the title after a mention of `decisions.md`: quoted (`decisions.md`, "Title" or `decisions.md`
("Title"), the quote may wrap to the next comment line), quoted after `(decisions, `, or bare and closing a parenthesis
(`decisions.md`, Title). It resolves when it is exactly an entry of the index, `docs/decisions.md`, or when it is the
start of exactly one `##` or `###` heading or bold lead in `docs/decisions/`: citations name a part inside a decision,
or shorten a long title. A trailing "..." is dropped.

The index is true when each entry's file has a `## ` heading with the entry's exact title, and every `## ` heading in
`docs/decisions/` has an entry pointing at its file."""
